Applied Challenge #1 Functional Deliverable:
Scope Statement: My project will be a function of the Sage Student Bistro
that will provide a functioning Google Map, an online reservation function
using Opentable, a menu PDF featuring the Sage Student Bistro's full menu,
and a functioning survey form. Each page will contain a custom theme and css
stylings. The survey will be sent straight to the Sage Student Bistro website.

The Wireframe will be uploaded with the repository as I have no way to export it.

Usablity Test:
Both users immediately used the menu link to get an idea of what they would want.
They stopped for the longest time to read the menu page, followed by the Google Maps
page. They tended to skip the reservations page, as it was not a function they
needed. The testers had no problem finding any one specific thing on my website.
The testers advised me that I should make my custom theme easier on the eyes, as
the bright yellow/blue coloration was confusing to them. To summarize, both tests
went well. The users were able to read everything clearly and could locate what
they needed when they needed it. The only issue was the coloration of my theme.
